Enjoy these pictures of penguins used with my premium subscription of ChatGPT that I'm trying to make worth $20 a month! 
```{r}
library(grid)
library(png)

# Read the .png image file
img <- readPNG("penguin1.png")

# Create a grid plot with the image
grid.newpage()
grid.raster(img)

# Read the .png image file
img2 <- readPNG("penguin2.png")

# Create a grid plot with the image
grid.newpage()
grid.raster(img2)
